For four-player chess the same algebraic notation as for regular chess can be used:

K = king
Q = queen
R = rook
B = bishop
N = knight
No letter is used for pawn moves.

When the move is a capture, an x is inserted between the origin and destination square.

If two pieces of the same type can move to the same square, the file or rank of origin (or both, if necessary) are added after the piece's letter.

Pawn promotion is indicated by appending =Q to the move (or, in case of underpromotion, =N, =B or =R).

Kingside castling (short castle) is notated as O-O and queenside castling (long castle) as O-O-O.

Check is indicated by appending + to the move and in case of double and triple check ++ and +++, respectively.

Checkmate is indicated by appending # to the move.

Players commonly prepend moves with one letter to indicate the colour of the piece, if that may not be clear from the context: r for red, b for blue, y for yellow and g for green. For example, bQxh14+ means blue queen takes h14 and rQxn8+ means red queen takes n8.
