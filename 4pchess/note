The functions are called in the order of the pieces in the pieces array, not in the order they appear in the switch statement.

The Move class is a fixed-size structure that includes all possible fields for any move type (standard, pawn, castling, etc.), even if some fields are unused for certain move types.

The total size is approximately 15-16 bytes per Move object (depending on padding/alignment)

The goal is to reduce the "Total nodes" number while maintaining or improving playing strength. Even a 10% reduction would be significant at this level.

iteration on depth, outer loop
with different alpha and beta, inner loop

Fail Low (evaluation <= alpha)
Fail High (evaluation >= beta)
After each fail, delta increases by 33% (delta += delta / 3)
If it fails 5+ times, gives up and uses full window

full window:
alpha = -kMateValue;
beta = kMateValue;

After the inner loop completes successfully (finding a stable evaluation within the alpha-beta window), the outer loop increments the depth and starts the process over

Move() creates a null/invalid move

// Example usage:
int64_t some_hash = 0x1234abcd;  // Your hash value
if (player.IsKnownCheckmate(some_hash)) {
    // This hash corresponds to a known checkmate position
    std::cout << "Hash 0x" << std::hex << some_hash << " is a known checkmate" << std::dec << std::endl;
}

// In your search function:
if (IsKnownCheckmate(board)) {
    // This position is already known to be checkmate
    return std::make_tuple(-kMateValue, std::nullopt);
}

--- no legal moves or checkmates
